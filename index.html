<h1>Welcome to my world</h1>
<p>If you see this page, then your heart is still beating, whcih means you are alive. I just want to say I Love You. Why did you do that to me. You are always allowing guys into your home. The sad thng is, you don't even tell me and when I confront you about it, you snubs me and gives me cheeky answers. You put my heart through pain but I forgive you.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for reading. Byeeeee. I LOVE YOU BELLA!.</em></p>
